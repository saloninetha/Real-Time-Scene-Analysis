# Real-Time-Scene-Analysis
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that enables real-time scene understanding from webcam-recorded videos using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model. It integrates multimodal capabilities (image + text) to interpret, summarize, and answer user questions about video content.



#Project Overview
This is an AI-powered Webcam Image Analyzer that uses multimodal capabilities to analyze real-time images captured from your webcam. It allows users to ask natural language questions about the image, and provides smart, context-aware responses using Gemini 2.0 Flash and external web search tools.
